## SejongGlobalBuddy

The Sejong Global Buddy web app project is a university project for the Web Programming course 
during my student exchange or Compulsory Study Abroad (CSA) program at Sejong University, South Korea. 
This website is inspired by my experience as a Sejong Global Buddy program member. 
In Global Buddy, foreign exchange students are paired with Korean students to help them transition into Korean culture 
and college life while meeting many new friends through various events and activities. 
However, events are often announced through Kakao Talk group chats, and to register, 
we need to contact the PIC through their personal chat, which could be complicated. 
That is why, I am inspired to create a website for Global Buddy where members can register 
and log in, then view, and sign up for the events that they want.


## Features

Users have to register as a member of Global Buddy to access the website. Registered members can login
to access the website, view events, and register for events.
